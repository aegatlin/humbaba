# humbaba

Nobody knows what humbaba is yet.

## Dev Notes

1. Prettier does not always format in ways that I personally find to be more readable. I don't automate prettier as a result. Instead, I'll run it manually every once in a while and only commit the changes I appreciate.
1. Do run sql scripts against the db locally, do `psql -d humbaba_dev -U postgres -f [file_name.sql]`.
